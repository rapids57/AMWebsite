            <p>This sunday I went to a concert for a band called the Me First and the Gimme Gimmes.</p>
            <p>Essentially, they're a cover band who do songs from different eras, such as 80s, 90s, and </p>
            <p>surprisingly, even 2020s. Before we went to the show, we went to this eatery that served</p>
            <p>pizza. It's not their main thing, but they did it pretty well.</p>
